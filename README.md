"Do stuff. Be clenched, curious. Not waiting for inspiration's shove or society's kiss on your forehead. Pay attention. It's all about paying attention. Attention is vitality. It connects you with others. It makes you eager. Stay eager." - :woman: Susan Sontag.

"The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future. You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else. " - Gabe Newell
